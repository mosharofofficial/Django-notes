# Django-notes

## Project Setup:
---
First we need to setup a django project in a virtual environment so that other packages don't conflict with the packeges used in the project.
The following code creates a python virtual environment:
```cmd
python -m venv env
```
Now we have to install the required packages with pythons package manager called ***pip***.
```cmd
pip install django
pip install pillow
```
To see what packages we have installed we can use the following command:
```cmd
pip freeze
```
